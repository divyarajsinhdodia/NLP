# Twitter-Feed-Hash-Tag
 I will be looking at what Twitter users said about a violent clash that broke out in Charlottesville, that is, major key topics that they discussed. I am also interested in finding out their tweeting behavior as well, such as when they tweeted their message, who the influential Twitter users were, and who was most active in the conversation. I used Twitter data available Kaggle, and I looked at 50,000 tweets. I uploaded them onto pandas and clean textual data using NLTK.
 install some of the pre required libraries as following:pandas,string,re,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib
